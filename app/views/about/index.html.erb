This page is designed to be a tribute for my absolute love and adoration of dogs. I use a total of three
data sources. The first one is a REST api that provides data about dogs, and what they are bred for.
I use this data source to fill in two of my tables, -Dogs and Breed. It provides all the information
you could need about a dog breed. It also gives you a url for an image of the breed.
My second data source provides fun facts for dogs, that I display in a random sequence.
The data source fills the quotes table. The final data source I use is Faker to provide
fake author names for my quotes table.<br>
